I Description
Fautes stands for Framework for AUto TESts. It provides tools for
automatic unit testing of software libraries. It relies on libcunit and adds
sugar arountd it.

II Content
This project consists in two independent parts
 * the tests launcher responsible to launch tests embedded into a .so
 * a library with with tools to ease the process of actually writing test

III Add Fautes support to a library
A library supporting Fautes has to declare the following symbols :
 * the library name fautes_lib_name LIBNAME
 * a suites set named LIBNAME_test_suites, which is a nul-terminated array of 
   test suites
 * optional, a LIBNAME_init_test_suites which is called before any test occur
   and which can for example enable / disable individual suites

IV Usage
Once the library supports fautes, to run the tests suites embedded into a .so,
one need to run :
     fautes SO_FILE [xml]
to actually run the tests. The xml flag, if present leads to the generation of
two xml files, CUnitAutomated-Listing.xml and CUnitAutomated-Results.xml.
without this flag, the result of the tests is echoed to standard output.
