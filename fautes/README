                                Fautes



I   Description
    Fautes stands for Framework for AUto TESts. It provides tools for
automatic unit testing of software libraries and executables. It relies on
libcunit and adds sugar around it.

II  Content
    This project consists in two independent parts
 * the tests launcher fautes responsible to launch tests embedded into a .so,
 which acts as a plugin of the fautes executable
 * an optional library (libfautes) with with tools to ease the process of
 actually writing test

III Add Fautes support to a library
    A library supporting Fautes has to declare (and fill in) only one symbol :
	struct pool_t fautes_pool
which will contain the information for initializing, running and cleaning the
test suites.

IV  Usage
    Once the library supports fautes, to run the tests suites embedded into a
.so, one need to run :
     fautes [xml] SO_FILES
to actually run the tests in all the .so files listed. The xml flag, if present
leads to the generation of two xml files, TEST_POOL_NAME-Listing.xml and
TEST_POOL_NAME-Results.xml, for each library tested.
    Without this flag, the result of the tests is echoed to standard output.

V   Tips
 * Without the xml flag, fautes writes to standard output, so tests should write
to standard error in order to ease filtering
 * embedding unit tests in an executable is possible, with the following flags
 passed to the linker at the program's linkage :
	-pie  -rdynamic -Wl,--no-gc-sections
